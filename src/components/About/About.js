                Remember being a child and the feeling you had when your parents would display your art on the refrigerator?   Can you remember when your teacher would hang up your art on the classroom walls for everyone to view?  How did that make you feel?  Did you feel excited, happy or most importantly proud of yourself for what you did?  Our inspiration to create Color My Doodle derived from our childhood memories of being able to color in coloring books and display our art for everyone to enjoy.

                At Color Couture we wanted to make an interactive clothing brand that creates a creative activity for your child.  Just use a washable crayon, color inside the doodle picture, wear your artwork and repeat. Itâ€™s that simple. With many styles to choose from we guarantee your child will have many hours of fun.
